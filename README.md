Abstract
Newtonâ€™s Law of Cooling is the fundamental ingredient for a basic model of popcorn popping. Depending on the heat of a given stove or the time the popcorn is cooked, popcorn will either not pop at all or burn completely. Our main purpose is two-fold: to find both an optimal temperature and and optimal cooking time to minimize burned kernels and maximize popped kernels. Modeling this phenomena for a single kernel requires an understanding of the Ideal Gas Law (P V = nrT). For a whole batch of popcorn, a sample of kernels are drawn at random from a distribution based on the pressure required to rupture them. We find that our model favors cooking the popcorn at higher temperatures with lower cook times to avoid burning individual kernels.
